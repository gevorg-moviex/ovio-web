            info: "On October 4-6, the Armenia Marriott Hotel hosted the conference “Management, Risk, Control: Institute of Internal Auditors-Armenia”. International conference “Promoting Cooperation”. The conference was attended by about 200 specialists from the private, public and financial sectors. OVIO acted as a partner of the event. The opening session of the conference “Information Technologies and Artificial Intelligence” was held by OVIO Director Hayk Faramazyan, who presented the role of corporate governance, risks and control in the world of modern technologies. “Management has become a problem in the modern digital world. As technologies develop, new risks arise, and IT audits must not only analyze realities, but also prevent risks and create tools that lead to progress. To use the full potential of technology, organizations must promote cooperation between IT audit and risk management teams. Individual practices are no longer viable in today's rapidly changing environment,” said Hayk Faramazyan, CEO of OVIO. The conference featured speakers from experienced professionals from Armenia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and South Africa, who discussed current issues of governance, risks, audit and control, as well as the experience of implementing new technologies in the field of information security and artificial intelligence. The importance of forming a corporate culture was presented, as well as the impact of changes in the new internal audit standards for the public and private sectors. Participants had the opportunity to discuss the mentioned topics in a roundtable format and share their findings with the participation of experienced experts. OVIO, being one of the leading companies in fixed Internet and television services in the market for both individuals and legal entities, launched the largest data center in Armenia in 2024 in May, already successfully providing a number of cloud services and other digital solutions. The Institute of Internal Auditors of Armenia was founded in 2012 and is a partner of the international organization Institute of Internal Auditors-Global in Armenia."

            info: "In the digital world, cybersecurity is of great importance to the telecom industry. Telecom companies handle large amounts of sensitive data and provide critical communications infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. How Telecom Companies Protect Data and Networks 1. Encryption: Data traveling over networks is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access and interception. 2. Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems: Modern firewalls and intrusion detection systems monitor and block malicious activity in real time. 3. Regular security audits: Frequent security checks help identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 4. Multi-factor authentication (MFA): Implementing MFA adds an extra layer of security for accessing sensitive systems and data. 5. Employee training: Ongoing training programs ensure that employees are aware of the latest cyber threats and best practices. 6. Partnering with cybersecurity companies. Partnering with specialist cybersecurity companies allows telecoms companies to leverage cutting-edge technology and expertise. Cybersecurity is a critical component of the telecoms industry, protecting both the infrastructure and the vast amounts of data that flow through it. In an increasingly digital world, maintaining comprehensive cybersecurity measures is the only way to gain customer trust and remain relevant and in demand."
